# React-Chat by LR

This chat is designed using the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework and a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database (thanks to [Facebook](https://reactjs.org/) and [Google](https://firebase.google.com/)!).

A version with a back-end designed by me using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database will be available after it is completed.
